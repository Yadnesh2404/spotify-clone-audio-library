- `public/audio/` - Directory containing audio files organized by genre

## Adding Your Music

1. Place your audio files in the appropriate folders under `/public/audio/`
2. Rename files to match the track numbering (track1.mp3, track2.mp3, etc.)
3. Update the track information in `main.js` to match your files

## Custom Playlist Images

The application now supports custom images for playlists. To add custom images:

1. Place your image files in the `/public/images/` directory
2. For the Hip Hop playlist, replace the placeholder file at `/public/images/hip-hop.jpg` with your preferred image
3. Make sure your image has a good aspect ratio (1:1 recommended) for best display
